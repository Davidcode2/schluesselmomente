    # === Routing for the API Endpoint ===
    # Use RewriteEngine to map the public URL to the internal script path
    RewriteEngine On

    # This rule says:
    # If the request URI starts with /api/contact
    # Internally rewrite the request to /var/www/app/process_contact_form.php
    # [L] means stop processing rules if this one matches
    # This essentially tells Apache: "Treat requests for /api/contact as requests for the script file located here."
    RewriteRule ^/api/contact$ /var/www/app/process_contact_form.php [L]


    # Ensure requests for the *actual* script file are handled as PHP.
    # This <Files> block ensures that when the RewriteRule above leads to
    # /var/www/app/process_contact_form.php, Apache knows to execute it as PHP.
    <Files process_contact_form.php>
        SetHandler application/x-httpd-php
    </Files>

# You might need additional configuration depending on the default Apache setup
# in the php:8.2-apache image, but this provides the core routing needed.
